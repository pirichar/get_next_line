//int read(int fd, char *buf, int count)
//fd = fd from where it reads
//buf = buffer of destination (where it's gonna be located)
//count = nombre d'octets Ã  lire
//read renvois le nombre d'octets lus ou -1 en cas d'erreurs

//Defenition of the function :
/* 1- Calling get_next_line in a loop will allow you to read the text 
 * available in the fd one line at the time untill the end of it 
 * 2-Your Function should return the line that has just been read.
 * if there is nothing else to read or if an error occured it should return NULL
 * 3- make sure that the function behaves well when it reads
 * from a file and when it reads from the standard input
 * 4- Libft is not allowed here,you must add a get_next_line_utils.c
 * file if you need more functions to make your function work.
 * 5-Your program must compile with the flag -D BUFFER_SIZE = XX
 * which will be used as the buffer size for the read calls.
 * this value will be modified by your evaluators and the moulinette
 * 6-The program will be compile this way :
 * gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 <files>.c
 * 7-Your read must use the BUFFER_SIZE defined during 
 * the compilation to read from a fil or strdin.
 * 8- In the header fil get_next_line.h you must have at least
 * the prototype of the function get_next_line.
 * 9- the returned line should include the '\n' exceot if you
 * have reached the end of file and there is no '\n'
 */

/*to do list :
 * Take as an example a file to do the whole thing then just add an exception to read the strdin (fd 2 or 3)
 * My function need to print out only the first string before I hit a return 
 * Since my function needs to get call in a loop it should only return one line at a time always
 * I need to store the remains of my buffer into someting and clear that before I try to read again the next iteration
